# Blockchain-Enabled Accessibility Compliance Tracking System

A transparent, immutable platform for managing and verifying accessibility compliance across facilities, powered by blockchain technology.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a trusted, verifiable record of accessibility compliance assessments, improvements, and certifications. By storing this information on a distributed ledger, it ensures transparency, prevents tampering with compliance records, and builds trust among all stakeholders, particularly people with disabilities who rely on accurate accessibility information.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Facility Assessment Contract

This contract maintains a permanent record of accessibility assessments for facilities.

**Features:**
- Comprehensive accessibility assessment data storage
- Support for multiple accessibility standards (ADA, WCAG, local regulations)
- Timestamped, immutable assessment records
- Photo and documentation storage via IPFS integration
- Geolocation tagging for physical facilities
- Detailed compliance scoring across categories
- Inspector credentials and certification verification

### Improvement Tracking Contract

This contract manages the lifecycle of accessibility improvements and remediation efforts.

**Features:**
- Deficiency tracking linked to specific assessment findings
- Improvement planning with milestone tracking
- Budget allocation and expense tracking
- Contractor verification and qualification management
- Before/after evidence storage for completed improvements
- Deadline management with automated notifications
- Progress reporting and visualization
- Compliance timeline forecasting

### Certification Contract

This contract issues and manages verifiable accessibility compliance credentials.

**Features:**
- Tamper-proof certification issuance
- Tiered certification levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- Expiration date management and renewal tracking
- QR code generation for on-site verification
- Public verification portal
- Certification history for each facility
- Conditional certification with improvement requirements
- Certification revocation capabilities with mandatory reasoning

### User Feedback Contract

This contract collects and manages feedback from people with disabilities about facility accessibility.

**Features:**
- Anonymous feedback submission capability
- Structured feedback categories (mobility, vision, hearing, cognitive)
- Severity rating system for reported issues
- Photo and documentation upload for identified barriers
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Feedback aggregation and trend analysis
- Facility response tracking
- Incentive system for valuable feedback

## Benefits
